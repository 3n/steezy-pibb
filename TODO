move css stuff to client class

use setInterval?

Keep a running list of all links posted and who posted them in the DOM

don't mark all read on auto-replies

Preferences form (injected on bottom)
- colors for messages

- setting away message: any message with one of your aliases in it will be replied to 
  automatically with a message. Just transfer the contents of some input into the message
  input and submit that shit. Maybe also have an "away" checkbox.
  
- give the message class a reference to the client class that it belongs to

MAYBE

- Make an Element wrapper class for add_class and remove_class kinda things?

- Somehow the script makes highlighting message-internals impossible in fluid...

Hawt-keys
- tab switching
- mark all as read
- focus input bar
  
- handle tab switching (detect if tab is switched and do the right thing)
