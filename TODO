convert all the self.xxx bullshit to just using vars (especially for private instance methods)

move css stuff to client class

use setInterval?

Keep a running list of all links posted and who posted them in the DOM

don't mark all read on auto-replies

Preferences form
- colors for messages
  
- give the message class a reference to the client class that it belongs to

MAYBE

- Make an Element wrapper class for add_class and remove_class kinda things?

- Somehow the script makes highlighting message-internals impossible in fluid...

Hawt-keys
- tab switching
- mark all as read
- focus input bar
  
- handle tab switching (detect if tab is switched and do the right thing)
