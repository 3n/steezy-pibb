!!! FYI: this thing it just getting started, so it barely works (at best). Have fun.

DONE SO FAR

  Fluid Specific
  - # of new messages on dock, for currently focused tab.
  - Inserts input on page for comma-delineated list of strings to growl alert on.  
  
  Usability
  - Clicking in message window clears unread messages and focuses message input.
  - If you type message it is marked as unread.
  - When you enter a message, all previous messages are marked as read.
  
  Message Styling
  - Messages with one of your alert strings in it.
  - Messages you wrote.


TODO

  - Somehow the script makes highlighting impossible...

  - Remember alias input's value w/ a cooooookie.

  - highligth matched name (in message window and growl alert)
  
  - setting away message: any message with one of your aliases in it will be replied to 
    automatically with a message. 
  
  Hawt-keys
  - tab switching
  - mark all as read
  - focus input bar
    
  - handle tab switching (detect if tab is switched and do the right thing)
  
  Restructure classes 
  - everything specific to pibb and fluid should be extracted into their own classes.
  - if fluid isn't there just create duplicate alert/badge methods that are empty.
    
  Preferences form (injected on bottom)
  - to growl or not to growl
  - growl stickiness
  - colors for messages
