BRIEF OVERVIEW

  This script aims to make the experience of using a web-based chat client
  completely awesome. It is to be used as either a userscript in Fluid or 
  Firefox (with Greasemonkey). 
  
  Currently only Pibb is supported, but more will come later. 
  
  It adds things like coloring unread messages, number
  of unread messages on OSX dock (in Fluid only), Growl alerts for any string
  in a user-supplied list of strings (Fluid & Firefox + Callout extension), 
  coloring of messages that contain any of aforementioned strings and a few other
  niceties.


DONE SO FAR

  Fluid Specific
  - # of new messages on dock, for currently focused tab.
  - Inserts input on page for comma-delineated list of strings to growl alert on.  
  
  Firefox + Callout plugin https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/7458
  - Inserts input on page for comma-delineated list of strings to growl alert on.
  
  Usability
  - Clicking in message window clears unread messages and focuses message input.
  - If you type message it is marked as unread.
  - When you enter a message, all previous messages are marked as read.
  
  Message Styling
  - Messages with one of your alert strings in it.
  - Messages you wrote.


TODO

  - Somehow the script makes highlighting message-internals impossible in fluid...

  - highlight matched name (in message window and growl alert)
  
  - setting away message: any message with one of your aliases in it will be replied to 
    automatically with a message. 
  
  Hawt-keys
  - tab switching
  - mark all as read
  - focus input bar
    
  - handle tab switching (detect if tab is switched and do the right thing)
    
  Preferences form (injected on bottom)
  - to growl or not to growl
  - growl stickiness
  - colors for messages
