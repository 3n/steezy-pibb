Steezy Pibb
by Ian Collins and Toby Sterret,
Grade 3

BRIEF OVERVIEW

  This script aims to make the experience of using a web-based chat client
  completely awesome. It is to be used as either a userscript in Fluid or 
  Firefox 3 (with Greasemonkey). 
  
  Currently only Pibb is supported, but more will come later. 
  
WHAT IT DOES

  Fluid Specific
  - # of new messages on dock, for currently focused tab.
  
  Fluid or Firefox + Callout plugin https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/7458
  - Inserts input on page for comma-delineated list of strings to growl alert on.
  
  Usability
  - Clicking in message window clears unread messages and focuses message input.
  - If you type message it is marked as unread, as well as all others above it.
  - When elements are injected by this script the message window will scroll
    to fit them, unless the user is currently scrolled upwards in the conversation
    (because that would get annoying).
    
  Away status auto-reply
  - Enter a string into the provided "away message" text box and check "away" - now
    anytime someone mentions one of your aliases it will submit that string you
    provided as a message automatically. 
  
  Message Styling
  - Unread messages are colored. 
  - Message with aliases from alias list highlighted.
  - Messages you wrote are colored for quick-scanning chat history.
  
  FUN
  - Inserting of img tags for messages that contain img urls. 
  - Inserting of images of tweets when a tweet url is in a message.
  - Put someone's alias and the string "HAHA" in a message if they did some stupid shit.
  - "sadtrombone" or "wah" in a message to bring up a sadtrombone button.
  - In-lined emoticons.
  - In-lining of YouTube videos. 
  
  PREFERENCES
  - Almost all of the above features can be configured through a cookie-saved, inline form.
  
  I also made a Fluid icon for Pibb, here: http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/33956/pibb_icon.png

  Firefox
    1.  Install Greasemonkey 
        https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/748
    2.  Install Callout plugin (currently requires Mozilla login) 
        https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/7458
    3.  Install this script

HOW TO MAKE IT WORK

  There should be a little INPUT box at the bottom right or left of your screen.
  Fill it in with a list of aliases, comma-separated without spaces (e.g. "ian,3n,titanian,everyone").
  If any of those strings appear in a message, it will turn orange and you 
  should get a growl alert. It is saved in a cookie, so you should only have
  to write it once. 



TODO

  Preferences form (injected on bottom)
  - colors for messages
  
  - setting away message: any message with one of your aliases in it will be replied to 
    automatically with a message. Just transfer the contents of some input into the message
    input and submit that shit. Maybe also have an "away" checkbox.
    
  MAYBE

  - Make an Element wrapper class for add_class and remove_class kinda things?

  - Somehow the script makes highlighting message-internals impossible in fluid...
  
  Hawt-keys
  - tab switching
  - mark all as read
  - focus input bar
    
  - handle tab switching (detect if tab is switched and do the right thing)
