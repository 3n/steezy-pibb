!!! FYI: this thing it just getting started, so it barely works (at best). Have fun.

DONE SO FAR

  - Growl alert for a given string (see todo)
  - # of new messages on dock, for currently focused tab.
  - Clicking in message window clears unread messages and focuses message input.


TODO

  - insert input for what string(s) to search for
  - if you type message make it unread right away 
  - highligth matched name (in message window and growl alert)
  - Hawt-keys:
    - tab switching
    - mark all as read
    - focus input bar
  - handle tab switching (detect if tab is switched and do the right thing)
