Steezy Pibb
by Ian Collins,

BRIEF OVERVIEW

  This script aims to make the experience of using a web-based chat client
  completely awesome. It is to be used as either a userscript in Fluid or 
  Firefox 3 (with Greasemonkey). 
  
  Currently only Pibb is supported, but more will come later. 
  
WHAT IT DOES

  - Coloring unread messages (click message window to mark as read and give focus to message input).
  - Number of unread messages on OSX dock (in Fluid only).
  - Growl alerts for any string in a user-supplied list of strings (Fluid or Firefox + Callout extension).
    Also highlights the alias(es) it found in the message. 
  - Coloring of messages that contain any of aforementioned strings.
  - Inserting img tags for messages that contain img urls. 
  - Inserting images of tweets when a tweet url is in a message.
  
  I also made an icon, here: http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/33956/pibb_icon.png
  
HOW TO INTALL IT
  
  Fluid
    1.  Make sure you have the latest Fluid
        http://www.fluidapp.com/
    2.  Save the script and put it into your ~/Library/Application\ Support/Fluid/SSB/<app name>/Userscripts/
        directory. 
    3.  Set the icon to this
        http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/33956/pibb_icon.png
  
  Firefox
    1.  Install Greasemonkey 
        https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/748
    2.  Install Callout plugin (currently requires Mozilla login) 
        https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/7458
    3.  Install this script
        http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/30798d
        
HOW TO MAKE IT WORK

  There should be a little INPUT box at the bottom right or left of your screen.
  Fill it in with a list of aliases, comma-separated without spaces (e.g. "ian,3n,titanian,everyone").
  If any of those strings appear in a message, it will turn orange and you 
  should get a growl alert. It is saved in a cookie, so you should only have
  to write it once. 



DONE SO FAR

  Fluid Specific
  - # of new messages on dock, for currently focused tab.
  - Inserts input on page for comma-delineated list of strings to growl alert on.  
  
  Firefox + Callout plugin https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/7458
  - Inserts input on page for comma-delineated list of strings to growl alert on.
  
  Usability
  - Clicking in message window clears unread messages and focuses message input.
  - If you type message it is marked as unread.
  - When you enter a message, all previous messages are marked as read.
  
  Message Styling
  - Messages with one of your alert strings in it.
  - Messages you wrote.


TODO

  - clean up the dynamic css shit. make it parse one big string of rules.

  - scroll message window to bottom after insert of image.

  - EMOTICONS (Toby's idea)

  - Somehow the script makes highlighting message-internals impossible in fluid...
  
  - setting away message: any message with one of your aliases in it will be replied to 
    automatically with a message. (Requires server communication - could be hell of painful)
  
  Hawt-keys
  - tab switching
  - mark all as read
  - focus input bar
    
  - handle tab switching (detect if tab is switched and do the right thing)
    
  Preferences form (injected on bottom)
  - to growl or not to growl
  - growl stickiness
  - colors for messages
