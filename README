!!! FYI: this thing it just getting started, so it barely works (at best). Have fun.

DONE SO FAR

  Fluid Specific
  - # of new messages on dock, for currently focused tab.
  - Inserts input on page for comma-delineated list of strings to growl alert on.  
  
  Usability
  - Clicking in message window clears unread messages and focuses message input.
  - If you type message it is marked as unread.
  
  Message Styling
  - Messages with one of your alert strings in it.
  - Messages you wrote.


TODO

  - highligth matched name (in message window and growl alert)
  - Hawt-keys:
    - tab switching
    - mark all as read
    - focus input bar
  - handle tab switching (detect if tab is switched and do the right thing)
  - restructure classes: everything specific to pibb and fluid should be extracted into their own classes.
  
  
NOTES
  
  Yeah I know the mutexes aren't necessary - but some JS implementation at some point 
  will have threading, and it'll probably be webkit first.
