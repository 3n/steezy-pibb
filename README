DONE SO FAR

  Fluid Specific
  - # of new messages on dock, for currently focused tab.
  - Inserts input on page for comma-delineated list of strings to growl alert on.  
  
  Firefox + Callout plugin https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/7458
  - Inserts input on page for comma-delineated list of strings to growl alert on.
  
  Usability
  - Clicking in message window clears unread messages and focuses message input.
  - If you type message it is marked as unread.
  - When you enter a message, all previous messages are marked as read.
  
  Message Styling
  - Messages with one of your alert strings in it.
  - Messages you wrote.


TODO

  - Somehow the script makes highlighting message-internals impossible in fluid...

  - highlight matched name (in message window and growl alert)
  
  - setting away message: any message with one of your aliases in it will be replied to 
    automatically with a message. 
  
  Hawt-keys
  - tab switching
  - mark all as read
  - focus input bar
    
  - handle tab switching (detect if tab is switched and do the right thing)
    
  Preferences form (injected on bottom)
  - to growl or not to growl
  - growl stickiness
  - colors for messages
